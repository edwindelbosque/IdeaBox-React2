# IdeaBox in React

## Summary

This project is a bit of a more simplified spin-off on my [IdeaBox](https://edwindelbosque.github.com/IdeaBox) notes app I did with another two developers a few months ago using core JS. I wanted to recreate this project using JS framework React for the first time. I thought it was a good opportunity to recreate a past project to be able to compare the differences in syntax using the same logic.

## Personal Goals

- First and foremost, get my hands dirty exploring React.
- Learn to pass information between components using props.
- Distingish the use of state vs props and class components vs functional components.
- Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Styling components separately.
- Figure out the process of deploying a React app into GitHub Pages.

## UI notes

I wanted to implement a dark-mode this time around, using not a complete dark contrast to make it easier on the eyes.
Used bright pastel colors and a flat design with subtle drop-shadows to create a simple depth in the UI.

## Built with:

- React
- CSS
